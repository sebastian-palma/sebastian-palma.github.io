I'm Sebastián Palma, a Software Developer mostly interested in databases, functional programming and foreign languages.

I write because I like it and to reinforce what I learn.

If you find any typo or error, you can feel free to write me to [vnhnhm at gmail dot com]. Or to directly comment using the Github [repository](https://github.com/vnhnhm/vnhnhm.github.io) of this project.
